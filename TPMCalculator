Hello,

I am using tpmcalculator installed in the cluster env with a .gtf annotation file. After running this -k default, I get the error message "Key gene_id for gene name was not found on GTF line. Error processing GTF line at Chromosome level:"

The parameters are as following:

tpmcalculator
-g ../Genomes/Gfus_x10_v51.gtf
-d inputdata_dir
-b Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
-k "gene_id"

The first couple line of my .gtf annotation file are:
JACGUE010004940	Gfus_x10_v4.gp	exon	23437	25151	.	-	.	transcript_id GFUI053061-RA; gene_id GFUI053061; gene_name GFUI053061

I have used TPMcalculator several times recently upto two days ago on a different data. I am not sure what is happening here
I will be grateful if someone can help with insight here.

Thank you in advance.
